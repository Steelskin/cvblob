# cvBlob

This library allows you to find and track blobs on a picture, using OpenCV.

## Dependencies

In order to compile cvBlob you need the following:

* CMAKE https://www.cmake.org
* OpenCV http://opencvlibrary.sourceforge.net
* A recent C++ compiler, that supports some C++11 features

## Compiling and installing

(This section is a Work In Progress)

In Linux, if you have unpacked the source in $CVBLOB, enter in a console:

```shell
cd $CVBLOB
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```

If you are encountering issues, please read [this](https://www.cmake.org/HTML/RunningCMake.html).

For Windows, a Visual Studio 2012 solution is provided in the vc subdirectory.

### OpenCV path

You can tell CMake where OpenCV is installed, in case it can't find it, using the `OpenCV_DIR` variable:

```shell
cmake . -DOpenCV_DIR=<path_to_OpenCV>
```

### Installation path

To change the destination path for the installation, set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable:

```shell
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path>
```
